### A lightweight, client-side framework for building user interfaces

---

**Point** is a lightweight, client-side framework for building UI for the web.
Its focus is on the view layer, and unlike many other frameworks,
**it uses plain HTML so it doesn't require you to learn a new syntax** â€”
which makes it extremely easy to pick up and use in your projects.

Point is a **no-bloatware framework** (only 4.7KB minified and gzipped),
and it doesn't have a bunch of "features" you'll end up not using.
It handles HTML rendering, data binding, and routing for Single-Page Applications.

Point is extensible, making it easy to create your own data modifiers
to suits your specific needs. And, if you want to use other liberaries,
you can, as Point plays nice with other.
